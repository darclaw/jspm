plan

each package lives in own directory
creates a "graphical" ./config -h for a package
packages live with a user
	user bob installs a package into his ~/packages, then only he has access to that package
	does not require root

//this exists at /packages and at ~/packages and at /root/packages
	/root/packages contains packages that need root access
	/packages are packages for all users
	~/packages are for only that user


structure
	sources
		git repos
	build-scripts
	builds
		has PREFIX=buildss/$PKGNAME/
		has EPREFIX=builds/$PKGNAME/
		has ?CONFIG-DIR?=builds/$PKGNAME/config/
	paths
		links to executables from builds
	libs
		links to libraries from builds

package manager
	search <pkgname>
		search github for pkg
	add <repo> 
		add repo to sources
		add to pkg-database 
	build <local-pkg>
		run build-scripts/<local-pkg>.build  on sources/<local-pkg>
		find libraries and executables
			add them to paths and libs
			add to pkg-database
		set installed date in pkg-database
	update <local-pkg>
		git pull sources/<local-pkg>
		set updated date in pkg-database
	remove <local-pkg>
		rm -r sources/<local-pkg>
		rm build-scripts/<local-pkg>.build
		remove broken symolic links
			paths
			libs
		remove from pkg-database

pkg-database
	probs just json file
	shema
		pkgs[{
			name,
			repo,
			file-location,
			install-date,
			updated-date,
			build-file,
			executables[{
				executable-name,
				executable-location
			}],
			libraries[{
				lib-name,
				lib-loc
			}],
			config-files[{
				type: dir or file,
				loc
			}]
		}]



		
need to figure out how to update the package manager
